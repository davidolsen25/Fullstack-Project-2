Project 2 submission for Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree by David Olsen

This program and database is meant to be used to run a swiss-style tournament. In a swiss tournament,
all players play all rounds of play. The standings keep track of the players wins and losses.
there are two tables in the database which are written in PostgreSQL ( tournament.sql ). One table is keeping track
of the players and their wins and losses. While another table is keeping track of the matches and the winner and loser of 
each match. The program is a Python file: ( tournament.py ). The program  and databse has the ability to delete 
matches, delete players, count players, register players, keep records of the standings of players, and to pair 
players with other players who have the same amount of wins.
